# Image Classification Using Transfer Learning (MobileNetV2)


## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to build an **image classification model** using **transfer learning** with TensorFlow. The model leverages a pre-trained **MobileNetV2** as a feature extractor to classify images based on a CSV file containing file paths and labels.  

The workflow includes:
- Loading and preprocessing images from CSV
- Label encoding
- Dataset creation with TensorFlow
- Training a transfer learning model
- Testing accuracy
- Making predictions on random test images

---

## Problem Description
Given a dataset of images with corresponding labels, the goal is to train a model that can accurately classify unseen images.

**Key Features:**
- Efficient use of MobileNetV2 for feature extraction
- CSV-based image dataset loader
- Train, validation, and test split
- Random image prediction visualization

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow (`pip install tensorflow`)
- Pandas (`pip install pandas`)
- NumPy (`pip install numpy`)
- Matplotlib (`pip install matplotlib`)
